# Tessera App

This directory contains the Tessera macOS app that makes it super easy to build and export patterns through a nice UI.

## Running the App

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You must open the `Tessera.xcworkspace` file at the root of the repository, **not** the `TesseraApp.xcodeproj` file in the `TesseraApp/` folder.

### Steps to run:

1. Open `Tessera.xcworkspace` (located at the root of the repository)
2. Select the "TesseraApp Debug" or "TesseraApp Production" scheme in Xcode
3. Choose "My Mac" as target device
4. Build and run
